         <body>  The Toronto Raptors are a basketball club headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
     The Toronto Raptors are a member of the Eastern Conference's Atlantic Division in the National Basketball Association (NBA). 
     They share Scotiabank Arena with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League, and they play their home games there (NHL).
      The club, along with the Vancouver Grizzlies, was established in 1995 as part of the NBA's expansion into Canada. 
      Since the Grizzlies relocated from Vancouver to Memphis, Tennessee in 2001-2002, the Raptors have been the league's only Canadian-based franchise.
