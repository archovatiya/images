        <body>  The Vancouver Whitecaps FC is a professional soccer team headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. 
    As a member of the league's Western Conference, they participate in Major League Soccer (MLS). 
    They were founded on March 18, 2009, and began play in 2011 as the city's 17th Major League Soccer franchise, replacing the same-named USSF Division 2 team. 
    Following graduating from the USSF after the 2010 season, the club has been owned and managed by the same group since their USSF days. 
    The team's MLS edition is a phoenix club, and it's the third to have the Whitecaps moniker. 
    The squad became the first Canadian team to qualify for the MLS Cup Playoffs in 2012.
